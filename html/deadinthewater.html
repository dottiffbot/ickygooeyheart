	I wrote this poem at 5am. It is a sweet summer memory. I like to float on my back in the water and be very still, which maybe looks like I'm dead.
	I still need to add alt text. I also want to figure out to make the text go in circles, but I've used a grid for now -->

<body class="body-grid">
	<header>
		<a href="./cakecrush.html"><img src="../assets/arrow.png" width="125px" height="125px"></a>
	</header>

	<div class="left"> <a href="../index.html"> <img src="../assets/arrow.png" width="125px" height="125px"></a></div>
	<div class="question"><img src="../assets/question.png" width="75px" height="75px">
<span class="message">find things unseen</span>
	</div>
<main class="main-container">
	<span id="v1">
 I focus on my breathing<br> and let myself float.
</span>
<br>
<span id="v2">
	My eyes closed with the sun <br> burning through, <br>red orbs, sloshing inner earths.
</span>
<br>
<span id="v3">
	You kept swimming towards me<br> as my body drifted with the tide.
</span>

<!-- made this coffin in cinema 4D. --> 

	<div class="coffin-container">
	<img src="../assets/coffin.png">
</div>

	<span id="v4">
		You reached only with your mouth <br> and planted quickly, sweetly.
	</span>
	<br>
	<span id="v5">
		I let you hold me, <br> still strands of hair stuck to eyelids.
	</span>
	<br>
	<span id="v6">
		In the ocean, on the edge of the earth. 
	</span>
